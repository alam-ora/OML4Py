![](images/topbar.png)

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** have become increasingly necessary for enterprises to translate today's data into direct business value. This course introduces learners to the basic concepts of AI/ML, using a mix of engaging lectures and hands-on activities to help you navigate the first steps in this exciting field. The exercises present real world use cases that show how Oracle is actively helping companies maximize business benefits through AI and ML.

This hands-on workshop focuses on Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4PY) which enables AI and ML capabilities of the Oracle Database in conjunction with the popular Python programming language and Jupyter notebooks.  You will learn to apply machine learning concepts and algorithms to solve real-world problems ranging from data acquisition and feature engineering, to creating ML models and tuning for optimal results.

## Workshop Requirements :

- The lab environment will be provided by Oracle on the Oracle Cloud. The students only need to bring a laptop with Microsoft Remote Desktop software preinstalled from the Microsoft Store (Windows) or Apple App Store (macOS).
- Knowledge of Python is a plus.
- No previous knowledge of machine learning required.

## Workshop Agenda :

- Introduction to the Lab Environment

- Introduction to Oracle Machine Learning for Python

_Introduction to the lab environment and setting up the student desktop/laptop for connecting to the lab virtual machine. The student will learn to use OML4Py to connect to the Oracle Database and move data between Python and the database. The lab also covers data exploration and manipulation of data using OML4Py&#39;s transparency layer, that allows the use of common python Pandas DataFrame functions on data residing in the Oracle database._

- Deep Dive on the Common ML Algorithms and Techniques

_Walk through the common techniques involved in data preparation for machine learning, including feature engineering, scaling, sampling, along with a brief overview on common algorithms used  for Regression, Classification, Clustering, Anomaly detection, etc._

- **Lab** : [Using Regression to estimate house prices] (Lab02.md)

_Explore the CA housing prices dataset and build machine learning models for predicting house prices in the state of California. The lab walks through a real-world use case and the steps to apply an AI/ML solution for building accurate prediction models. You begin with exploratory data analysis on the housing data and engineer optimal features to assist the ML algorithms. Then continue on with using multiple ML algorithms such as Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting, measure and compare respective prediction accuracies. You will also use in-database python execution for optimal execution of ML algorithms in the Oracle Database, and the OML4Py transparency layer functions._

- **Lab** : Build prediction models to classify fraudulent credit card transactions

_Build machine learning models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world data from financial institutions (Kaggle dataset). Prepare an unbalanced dataset using popular techniques such as under-sampling and utilize k-fold to learn iteratively and find the best hyperparameters for the algorithm. Create confusion matrix and compare prediction accuracy using Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression and Neural Nets. You will also learn to save python objects and scripts in the Oracle database, a feature of OML4Py._

- **Lab** : Clustering wine data using unsupervised learning algorithms

_Use unsupervised learning methods such as K-Means to cluster the Wine Data sourced from three different cultivars from Italy. Using data scaling and  dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and ICA, you will automatically generate independent set of features that help explain the variance in the dataset. Analyze the results of multiple approaches for clustering the Wine data and report accuracy._

- **Lab** : Using AutoML for automatic feature and model selection

_Automate end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems using the emerging AutoML techniques. In this lab you will use the automatic feature selection, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning of AutoML feature of OML4Py to quickly create high-quality machine learning models._
