# Oracle Machine Learning with Python Workshop

**Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning** have become increasingly necessary for enterprises to translate today's data into direct business value. This course introduces learners to the basic concepts of AI/ML, using a mix of engaging lectures and hands-on activities to help you navigate the first steps in this exciting field. The exercises present real world use cases that show how Oracle is actively helping companies maximize business benefits through AI and ML.

This hands-on workshop focuses on **Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py)** which enables AI and ML capabilities of the Oracle Database in conjunction with the popular Python programming language and Jupyter notebooks.  You will learn to apply machine learning concepts and algorithms to solve real-world problems ranging from data acquisition and feature engineering, to creating ML models and tuning for optimal results.
